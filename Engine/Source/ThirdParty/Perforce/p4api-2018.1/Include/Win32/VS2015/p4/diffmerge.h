 * diffmerge.h - 3 way file merge
 *
 * Classes defined:
 *
 *	DiffMerge - control block for merging
 *
 * Public methods:
 *
 *	DiffMerge::DiffMerge() - Merge 3 files to produce integrated result
 *	DiffMerge::~DiffMerge() - dispose of DiffMerge and its contents
 *	DiffMerge::Read() - produce next part of integrated result
 *
 * History:
 *	2-18-97 (seiwald) - translated to C++.

/*
 * SELBITS - the return value from DiffMergeRead
 *
 * 0 means no more output; otherwise the bits are set according to what
 * outputfile is to take the next piece.  The length of DiffMergeRead
 * can be zero while the bits returned are non-zero: this indicates a
 * zero length chunk to be placed in the output file.
 *
 * SEL_CONF indicates a conflict, and is set for each of the legs that
 * are in conflict, including the base.  Thus for a conflict the follow
 * sequence will be seen: 
 *
 *		SEL_CONF | SEL_BASE
 *		SEL_CONF | SEL_LEG1 | SEL_RSLT
 *		SEL_CONF | SEL_LEG2 | SEL_RSLT
 *
 * If changes are identical both lines, they are not in conflict.  The
 * sequence is:
 *
 *		SEL_BASE
 *		SEL_LEG1 | SEL_LEG2 | SEL_RSLT
 *
 * SEL_ALL indicates chunks synchronized between all 3 files.  The
 * actual text comes from LEG2, so that if the underlying diff is
 * ignoring certain changes (like whitespace), the resulting merge
 * will have the last leg (typically "yours") rather than the original
 * unchanged base.
