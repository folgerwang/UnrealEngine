/**
 * UGameplayAbility
 *	
 *	Abilities define custom gameplay logic that can be activated or triggered.
 *	
 *	The main features provided by the AbilitySystem for GameplayAbilities are: 
 *		-CanUse functionality:
 *			-Cooldowns
 *			-Costs (mana, stamina, etc)
 *			-etc
 *			
 *		-Replication support
 *			-Client/Server communication for ability activation
 *			-Client prediction for ability activation
 *			
 *		-Instancing support
 *			-Abilities can be non-instanced (native only)
 *			-Instanced per owner
 *			-Instanced per execution (default)
 *			
 *		-Basic, extendable support for:
 *			-Input binding
 *			-'Giving' abilities (that can be used) to actors
 *	
 *
 *	See GameplayAbility_Montage for an example of a non-instanced ability
 *		-Plays a montage and applies a GameplayEffect to its target while the montage is playing.
 *		-When finished, removes GameplayEffect.
 *	
 *	Note on replication support:
 *		-Non instanced abilities have limited replication support. 
 *			-Cannot have state (obviously) so no replicated properties
 *			-RPCs on the ability class are not possible either.
 *			
 *	To support state or event replication, an ability must be instanced. This can be done with the InstancingPolicy property.

	//
	//		TryActivateAbility()	- Attempts to activate the ability. Calls CanActivateAbility(). Input events can call this directly.
	//								- Also handles instancing-per-execution logic and replication/prediction calls.
	//		
	//		CallActivateAbility()	- Protected, non virtual function. Does some boilerplate 'pre activate' stuff, then calls ActivateAbility()
	//
	//		ActivateAbility()		- What the abilities *does*. This is what child classes want to override.
	//	
	//		CommitAbility()			- Commits reources/cooldowns etc. ActivateAbility() must call this!
	//		
	//		CancelAbility()			- Interrupts the ability (from an outside source).
	//
	//		EndAbility()			- The ability has ended. This is intended to be called by the ability to end itself.
